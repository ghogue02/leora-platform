# Run Safe Migration - Quick Start

## 🚀 **5-Minute Database Migration**

This will add missing schema elements to your Supabase database **without deleting any data**.

---

## ⚡ Quick Steps

### 1. Create Backup (2 minutes)
Go to Supabase Dashboard and create a backup:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqezunzlyjkseugujkrl/settings/database
```
Click **"Create Backup"** button.

### 2. Record Current Data (30 seconds)
Open Supabase SQL Editor and run this:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqezunzlyjkseugujkrl/sql/new
```

```sql
SELECT 'customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM customers
UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
UNION ALL SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```

**Write down the numbers** - they should be:
- Customers: 21,215
- Products: 1,937
- Orders: 4,268

### 3. Run the Migration (2 minutes)

#### Option A: Copy from File (Recommended)
1. Open: `prisma/safe-migration-from-existing.sql`
2. Copy the entire file
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** (or press `Cmd+Enter`)

#### Option B: Direct SQL (if file unavailable)
The SQL file is located at:
```
/Users/greghogue/Leora/prisma/safe-migration-from-existing.sql
```

### 4. Verify Success (30 seconds)

Run this in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check row counts (should match step 2)
SELECT 'customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM customers
UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
UNION ALL SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders;

-- Check for data loss (should be ZERO)
SELECT COUNT(*) as deleted_rows
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND n_tup_del > 0;
```

**Expected Results**:
✅ Row counts match step 2 exactly
✅ deleted_rows = 0

---

## 🎯 What This Does

### Creates (if missing):
- ✅ 36 database tables
- ✅ 20 enum types
- ✅ 40+ performance indexes
- ✅ Foreign key relationships

### Does NOT:
- ❌ Delete any data
- ❌ Modify existing rows
- ❌ Drop tables
- ❌ Truncate tables

---

## ⚠️ Expected Warnings (These are SAFE)

You may see these messages - they are **completely normal**:
- "type already exists" - Type was already created ✅
- "table already exists" - Table was already created ✅
- "index already exists" - Index was already created ✅

**These are NOT errors** - they mean the migration is working correctly.

---

## 🚨 Red Flags (Stop if you see these)

If you see ANY of these, **STOP and restore from backup**:
- 🚨 "X rows deleted" where X > 0
- 🚨 Row counts decreased
- 🚨 "permission denied" errors
- 🚨 "foreign key violation" errors

---

## 📊 After Migration

1. Visit: https://leora-platform.vercel.app
2. Log in with demo credentials
3. Check:
   - Dashboard loads ✅
