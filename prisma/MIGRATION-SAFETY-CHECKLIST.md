# Migration Safety Checklist

## Overview

This migration adds missing schema elements to the existing Leora Platform database while **preserving all 27,000+ rows of production data**.

**Migration File**: `prisma/safe-migration-from-existing.sql`

**Safety Level**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION-SAFE** - No data will be deleted or modified

---

## What This Migration Does

### 1. Creates Missing ENUM Types (if not exist)
- All 20 Prisma enum types (TenantStatus, UserStatus, OrderStatus, etc.)
- Uses exception handling to skip if already exists
- **Impact**: None on existing data

### 2. Creates Missing Tables (if not exist)
The following 36 tables will be created **only if they don't already exist**:

**Core Tenancy** (2 tables)
- `tenants`
- `tenant_settings`

**Identity & Access** (7 tables)
- `users`
- `roles`
- `permissions`
- `user_roles`
- `role_permissions`
- `portal_users`
- `portal_user_roles`
- `portal_sessions`

**Commerce: Products** (5 tables)
- `products`
- `skus`
- `inventory`
- `price_list_entries`
- `suppliers`

**Commerce: Customers** (2 tables)
- `customers`
- `suppliers` (if not created above)

**Commerce: Orders** (6 tables)
- `orders`
- `order_lines`
- `invoices`
- `payments`
- `carts`
- `cart_items`

**Commerce: Lists** (2 tables)
- `lists`
- `list_items`

**Intelligence** (5 tables)
- `activities`
- `call_plans`
- `tasks`
- `account_health_snapshots`
- `sales_metrics`

**Compliance** (2 tables)
- `compliance_filings`
- `state_tax_rates`

**Integrations** (4 tables)
- `webhook_subscriptions`
- `webhook_events`
- `webhook_deliveries`
- `integration_tokens`

**Notifications** (1 table)
- `notifications`

**Total**: 36 tables

### 3. Creates Performance Indexes (if not exist)
- 40+ indexes for optimized query performance
- All use `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
- **Impact**: Improves query speed, no data loss

---

## What This Migration DOES NOT Do

### ‚ùå NO Destructive Operations
This migration explicitly avoids:
- ‚ùå **NO** `DROP TABLE`
- ‚ùå **NO** `DROP COLUMN`
- ‚ùå **NO** `TRUNCATE`
- ‚ùå **NO** `DELETE`
- ‚ùå **NO** `UPDATE` (existing data)
- ‚ùå **NO** `ALTER TABLE ... DROP ...`
- ‚ùå **NO** `CREATE OR REPLACE`

### ‚úÖ Only Safe Operations
- ‚úÖ `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- ‚úÖ `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
- ‚úÖ `CREATE TYPE` (with exception handling)
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints (for new tables only)

---

## Pre-Migration Checklist

Before running the migration, verify:

### 1. Database Backup
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create a database backup in Supabase
  - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqezunzlyjkseugujkrl/settings/database
  - Click "Create Backup" or use pg_dump

### 2. Data Verification
- [ ] Record current row counts:
  ```sql
  SELECT 'tenants' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM tenants
  UNION ALL SELECT 'users', COUNT(*) FROM users
  UNION ALL SELECT 'customers', COUNT(*) FROM customers
  UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
  UNION ALL SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders;
  ```

  **Expected Counts** (from documentation):
  - Tenants: 1
  - Users: 5
  - Customers: 21,215
  - Products: 1,937
  - Orders: 4,268

### 3. Access Verification
- [ ] Confirm you can access Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqezunzlyjkseugujkrl/sql/new

---

## Migration Execution Steps

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqezunzlyjkseugujkrl/sql/new

### Step 2: Review the Migration SQL
1. Open `prisma/safe-migration-from-existing.sql`
2. Review each section carefully
3. Confirm no DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE commands

### Step 3: Run the Migration
1. Copy the entire contents of `safe-migration-from-existing.sql`
2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click **"Run"** or press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows)

### Step 4: Review Execution Results
- Check for any errors in the SQL Editor output
- Most "duplicate_object" errors are SAFE (means type already exists)
- "table already exists" errors are SAFE (means table already exists)

### Step 5: Run Verification Queries
The migration file includes verification queries at the end. Run them to check:

1. **Table Existence Check**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   ORDER BY tablename;
   ```
   Should show all 36 tables

2. **Row Count Verification**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 'customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM customers
   UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
   UNION ALL SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders;
   ```
   Should match pre-migration counts EXACTLY

3. **Data Loss Check** (should be 0):
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, n_tup_del as deletes
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND n_tup_del > 0;
   ```
   Should return **zero rows**

4. **Index Verification**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as index_count
   FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```
   Should show 40+ indexes

---

## Post-Migration Verification

### Critical Checks

#### 1. Data Integrity
- [ ] All row counts match pre-migration values
- [ ] No rows deleted (n_tup_del = 0)
- [ ] Sample queries return expected data:
  ```sql
  -- Test customer data
  SELECT id, company_name FROM customers LIMIT 5;

  -- Test product data
  SELECT id, name, sku FROM products LIMIT 5;

  -- Test order data
  SELECT id, order_number, total_amount FROM orders LIMIT 5;
  ```

#### 2. Schema Completeness
- [ ] All 36 tables exist
- [ ] All indexes created
- [ ] All enums created
- [ ] Foreign keys defined

#### 3. Application Testing
- [ ] Test site login: https://leora-platform.vercel.app
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Products page shows data
- [ ] Orders page shows data
- [ ] No database connection errors in logs

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ All tables created or already exist
‚úÖ All indexes created
‚úÖ All row counts unchanged
‚úÖ No deletion operations occurred
‚úÖ Application functions normally
‚úÖ Query performance improved (from new indexes)

### Acceptable Warnings
‚ö†Ô∏è "type already exists" - SAFE, type was already created
‚ö†Ô∏è "table already exists" - SAFE, table was already created
‚ö†Ô∏è "index already exists" - SAFE, index was already created

### Red Flags (Contact DBA immediately)
üö® "X rows deleted" where X > 0
üö® Row counts decreased
üö® Tables missing after migration
üö® Foreign key constraint violations
üö® Application cannot connect to database

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Something Goes Wrong

#### Option 1: Restore from Backup
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
2. Select pre-migration backup
3. Click "Restore"
4. Wait for restoration to complete (usually 5-15 minutes)

#### Option 2: Minimal Rollback (if only indexes added)
If only indexes were added and causing issues:
```sql
-- List all indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';

-- Drop specific index if needed
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_name_here;
```

#### Option 3: Manual Revert
If only a few tables were created and need removal:
```sql
-- Example: Remove newly created table (ONLY if it has no data)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name CASCADE;
```
**WARNING**: Only use this for empty tables created by this migration

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "type already exists"
**Status**: ‚úÖ Safe - Type was already created
**Action**: Continue, no action needed

### Issue: "table already exists"
**Status**: ‚úÖ Safe - Table was already created
**Action**: Continue, no action needed

### Issue: "column does not exist"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs investigation
**Action**: Check which columns are missing, may need ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN

### Issue: Foreign key constraint violation
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Data integrity issue
**Action**: Review foreign key relationships, may need data cleanup first

### Issue: Permission denied
**Status**: üö® Access issue
**Action**: Verify you're using correct Supabase credentials with admin privileges

---

## Performance Impact

### Expected Changes
- **Disk Usage**: Minimal increase (tables created with no data)
- **Index Size**: ~10-50 MB for 40+ indexes
- **Query Performance**: IMPROVED (new indexes optimize lookups)
- **Write Performance**: Slightly slower (index maintenance)
- **Connection Count**: No change

### Monitoring
After migration, monitor:
- Query response times (should improve)
- Index usage statistics
- Table scan counts (should decrease)

---

## Data Preservation Guarantee

This migration is designed with **zero data loss** as the highest priority:

1. **No Destructive Commands**: The SQL file contains ONLY creation commands
2. **Conditional Creation**: All objects use IF NOT EXISTS checks
3. **No Modifications**: Existing tables, columns, and data are never altered
4. **Backup First**: Always create backup before running
5. **Verification Built-in**: Multiple verification queries included

### Mathematical Guarantee
```
Rows Before Migration = Rows After Migration
27,000+ rows = 27,000+ rows
```

Any deviation from this equation indicates a problem and should trigger immediate rollback.
