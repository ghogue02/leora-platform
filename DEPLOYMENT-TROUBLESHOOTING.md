# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue**: Dashboard still showing errors despite local tests passing

**Root Cause**: Vercel was caching Prisma client between deployments

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Schema Corrections (Commit: d4b693e)
- ✅ OrderLine model - Removed non-existent fields (lineNumber, subtotal, etc.)
- ✅ CartItem model - Uses netPrice instead of subtotal
- ✅ All 14 API files updated

### 2. NULL Data Fix (Commit: 649bfc4)
- ✅ Backfilled 4,268 orders with NULL totalAmount
- ✅ Emergency SQL fix executed

### 3. Vercel Build Configuration (Commit: ce2322a)
- ✅ Removed `ignoreCommand` that was preventing rebuilds
- ✅ Ensures every commit triggers fresh build

---

## 🔍 Pattern Identified

**The Missing Pattern**: Vercel's build cache

**Problem**:
1. Prisma client is generated during `npm install` (postinstall)
2. Vercel caches `node_modules` including Prisma client
3. When schema changes, cached client still has OLD field definitions
4. Even though schema.prisma is updated, generated types are stale

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added explicit `prisma generate` to build command
- ✅ Removed `ignoreCommand` that was skipping rebuilds
- ✅ Forced fresh deployments with empty commits

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

**Latest**: https://leora-platform-8cnanapst... (deployed 1m ago)
**Build Status**: ● Ready
**Schema**: Correct (OrderLine without lineNumber)
**Data**: Fixed (0 NULL values)

## 🧪 Local Verification - ALL PASSING

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-deployed-schema.ts
```

Results:
```
✅ Tenant queries work
✅ Customer + company relation works
✅ Order count: 4,268
✅ OrderLine with netPrice works
✅ Recent orders with totals work
```

## 🚀 What Should Happen Now

### If Still Seeing Errors:
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear Vercel cache** via dashboard
3. **Check logs** for any remaining schema mismatches
4. **Provide screenshot** of error - I'll fix immediately
