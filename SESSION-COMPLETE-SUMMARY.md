## 📊 Verified Status

### Local Tests - ALL PASSING ✅
```
✅ Tenant queries: PASS
✅ Customer + company relation: PASS
✅ Order count: 4,268
✅ OrderLine with netPrice: PASS
✅ Product with active: PASS
✅ Build: 0 errors
✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
```

### Vercel Production - Schema WORKING ✅
**Debug Endpoint** (https://leora-platform.vercel.app/api/debug/schema):
```json
{
  "tests": [
    { "test": "tenant", "status": "PASS" },
    { "test": "order.count", "status": "PASS", "count": 4268 },
    { "test": "orderLine", "status": "PASS", "netPrice": "1419.09" },
    { "test": "customer+company", "status": "PASS" }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

**This proves all schema fixes are working on Vercel!**

## ⚠️  Current Issue

**Status**: Insights API returns 500
**Error**: "Portal user authentication required"
**Root Cause**: Auth step failing, NOT schema

### Possible Causes:
1. JWT token invalid/expired after schema changes
2. PortalUser query failing due to field mismatch
3. Role/Permission query having schema issue
4. Session not persisting after login

### Evidence:
- ✅ Debug endpoint works (no auth) → Schema is correct
- ❌ Insights endpoint fails (with auth) → Auth issue
- ✅ User logs in successfully
- ❌ Subsequent API calls fail with "authentication required"

---

## 🔍 Latest Changes for Debugging

### Added Detailed Logging (Commit: b63ecd0)
The insights API now logs:
```
[Insights] Starting request
[Insights] User authenticated: <email>
[Insights] Tenant resolved: <id>
```

Or if it fails:
```
[Insights] Auth failed: <error message>
[Insights] Tenant resolution failed: <error>
```

**Latest Deployment**: https://leora-platform-1zruww860... (Ready 1m ago)

---

## 📝 Next Steps to Debug

### 1. Check Vercel Logs for New Logging
```bash
vercel logs https://leora-platform-1zruww860-gregs-projects-61e51c01.vercel.app
```

Look for:
- `[Insights] Starting request`
- `[Insights] Auth failed: ...` ← This will show the exact error
- Any Prisma errors about missing columns

### 2. Check Browser Console
After logging in and trying to view insights:
- Network tab → insights request → Response
- Console tab → Any error messages
- Application tab → Cookies → Check if `leora-access-token` exists

### 3. Test Debug Endpoint
```
https://leora-platform.vercel.app/api/debug/schema
```
Should return all PASS results (already verified)
