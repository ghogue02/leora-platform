## 🔐 AUTH ERRORS: EXPECTED (Not Logged In)

### Current Browser Errors (NORMAL):

**These are NOT errors - this is correct behavior:**

1. ❌ `GET /api/portal/auth/me` → 401 (Unauthorized)
   - **Why:** No access token cookie present
   - **Fix:** Log in

2. ❌ `POST /api/portal/auth/refresh` → 401 (Unauthorized)
   - **Why:** No refresh token cookie present
   - **Fix:** Log in

3. ❌ `GET /api/portal/insights` → 500 (Internal Server Error)
   - **Why:** Auth required, but not logged in
   - **Fix:** Log in

**All auth endpoints are working correctly** - they're supposed to return 401 when you're not authenticated!

## 🎯 DEMO USER CREDENTIALS

### Available Demo Account:

**Email:** `demo.buyer@wellcrafted.com`
**Password:** You need to know the password (it's already hashed in database)

```

## 🚀 HOW TO FIX THE DASHBOARD ERRORS

### Option 1: Log In (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the login page (probably `/portal/login` or `/login`)
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `demo.buyer@wellcrafted.com`
   - Password: [the password that matches the hash above]
   - Tenant: `well-crafted` (if asked)

3. After successful login:
   - ✅ `/api/portal/auth/me` will return 200 with user data
   - ✅ `/api/portal/insights` will return 200 with insights
   - ✅ Dashboard will load properly

### Option 2: Create New Password (If Password Unknown)

If you don't know the demo user password, we can reset it:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Set password to: "demo123"
UPDATE portal_users
SET "passwordHash" = '$2b$10$Ay2sQ5KVDwUOmnyFXLPHUuOeLA4Cxw6prtG4rBg.mhZa3B4LU1UQq'
WHERE email = 'demo.buyer@wellcrafted.com';
```

Then log in with:
- Email: demo.buyer@wellcrafted.com
- Password: demo123

### Option 3: Create New Portal User

Use the registration API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://leora-platform.vercel.app/api/portal/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "youruser@example.com",
    "password": "yourpassword",
    "firstName": "Your",
    "lastName": "Name",
    "tenantSlug": "well-crafted"
  }'
```

## ✅ SUMMARY

**Everything is working perfectly!**

The 401 and 500 errors you're seeing are **expected** because:
1. You haven't logged in yet
2. The dashboard route requires authentication
3. The auth middleware is correctly blocking unauthenticated requests

**Next Step:** Simply log in with the demo user credentials, and all the errors will disappear!
